Modified by Soren Bjornstad to require 3 clicks instead of 2.

This plugin adds the ability to edit tiddlers by double clicking on its body.
Just try to edit any tiddler shown here by double clicking on it.

This can be considered a fast solution. It is only to fill the gap until TiddlyWiki adds support 
for it officially.
